# Chicago Energy Usage


To run this project, download the zipped archive and unzip the files into a new folder. Make sure all the files are together in the same location and run chicago_zips_topojson.html to open the project. Note that the map sometimes will not display if the webpage is opened using the Google Chrome browser. If you experience this problem, try opening it in a version of Mozilla Firefox instead.
